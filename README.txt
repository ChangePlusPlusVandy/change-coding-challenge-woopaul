Hello,
Despite having completed most of the code to run the game for the project, and learning how to use
Postman to get tweets through Twitter, I could not figure out how to integrate that into my project
here. I was able to see that Postman retrieved 3200 tweets each from Kanye and Elon, but I could not
 integrate the API into my project.

Where the actual tweets are supposed to go in the project are noted as "*display Elon Musk/Kanye
West tweet", and in the //TODO's.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Paul Woo
